# January 09, 2023 - Introduction to Version Control

*What is the difference between Git and GitHub?* - Git is a version controll system that works with or without the use of a network by tracking changes made to a document as opposed to creating countless copies. GitHub is a seperate web-based interface for using and sharing Git files across a network, enabling multiple users to collaborate simultaneously or a single user to work seamlessly across devices.

Version Control Systems are typically structured in one of two ways: **Centralized**, Which enables users to temporarily borrow files from a server before sending them back, and **Distributed**, which stores files on a local drive and on a server simultaneously.

Visual Studio Code uses a three color system to track changes to a file. **Green** signifies additions, **Blue** signifies changes, and **Red** signifies deletion.

There are also a number of useful commands that can be used in VSC. *Shift* + *cmd* + *P* Opens the Command Pallete. *Shift* + *cmd* + *X* Opens te Extensions Tab.

Finally, I got an 8/9 on the LinkedInLeanring quiz at the end of the lesson.
