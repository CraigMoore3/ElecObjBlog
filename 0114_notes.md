# January 14, 2023 - Blog Site Map

Working through ideas for class blog sitemap:

~~Notes, In-Class, Labs, Projects~~
^ too many categories, will be annoying to toggle between in/out of class notes.

**Notes** (in-class and independent)**, Labs, Projects**
^ this should work. Will keep notes consolidated and more easy to build on without toggling between different categories.

Still learning some markdown formatting. VSC presents an error when using subscript.
