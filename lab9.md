# Lab 9 - Transistors and Motors - April 05, 2023

Using a transistor to blink and fade an LED. Making a motor go using a transitor, relay, and driver.

## Prep

* I will admit, it took me way longer to get around to this lab than it should have. There were a number of reasons for this, all of which I don't feel like getting to.

* I read through the lab document several times before actually attempting the lab, being that this is by-far the most complicated and involved lab of the semester. Even having done this, I felt entirely insecure about actually attempting the motor portion of the lab.

## Process

* I started the transistor/LED Portion of the lab, which was more easy than I expected. To be honest, I'm not precisely sure when we learned to blink an LED without delay, since I can't seem to find the instructions for it in the previous lab docs nor my blog posts. In any case, I checked the Arduino website and used their suggested method for doing so.

* I built out the breadboard with the transistor/LED Combo, and successfully got the LED to blink using the code from the Arduino site, as well as getting it to fade with the code from the lab document.

* Next, I moved to the motor portion of the lab, which felt far more daunting.
