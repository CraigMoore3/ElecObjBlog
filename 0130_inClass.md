# January 30, 2023 - in class

This class meeting helped me make a lot of progress towards the refinement of my idea for the midterm.

A couple of the ideas that I brainstormed involve the implementation of voice/sound boxes found in everyday toys, greeting cards, and childrens books. To name a few:

* The Tower of Babel, using multiple toys trying and failing to "communicate"
  
* A "Necromancer Orchestra" performance of raising toys from the dead in song

* Toy 'phone booths' enabling the viewer to shape the conversation

* A general diorama scene

## Notes on Components

* Relays function like electronically controlled switches

* Capacitors function like small batteries

* USB Powers **HID: Human Interface Devices** like keyboards, mice, etc

* Check out [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/), [Digikey](https://www.digikey.com), [Newark](https://www.newark.com), [Tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com)

## Things to keep in mind

* Rob also reminded us to think of design approaches that move away from pure functionality (the laser cut box) and towards an actual art object with formal value

* Reed Ghazala is the father of circut bending
