# January 25, 2023 - Soldering

## Foundation of a circut

* **Copper face** - conductive
* **Soldermask** - green layer
* **Paper (FR1)** or **carbon fiber (FR4)** substrate middle layer
* **Silkscreened labels**

* **Traces / Tracks** - specific conductive paths linking components
* **Pads** - Where traces end
* **Through-hole (Th / Pth)** - components are soldered to back of board
* **Via** - plated hole that transfers from face plate to back plate

## Soldering basics

* **Tining** - Prepping the iron with a drop of solder
* **Flux** - eases process, removes oxide film from surface of metals
* Soldering paste works differently than spool of solder
* Clean > Tin > Heat wire/component > Apply solder to heated component > Clean
* **Solder Sucker** or **De-soldering Braid** are used to remove solder

## Wire

* Smaller guage numbers denote larger wires
* Stranded wire tends to work better for things that move, solid wire can snap
